      The mini pantry movement is a grassroots, crowd sourced solution to immediate and local need. Whether a need for food or a need to give, mini pantries help neighbors feed neighbors, nourishing neighborhoods.
    </p>

    <p class="das-paragraph">
      While there are already several organizations in Fairfield targeted at food insecurity, such as The Lord's Cupboard, Carry on Bags, and the AEA school lunch program, Little Free Pantries can fill some of the gaps for folks. Itâ€™s an anonymous, immediate way for folks to pick up what they can use to get by today. No strings attached, no questions asked.
